- Several "output filter" template files, for allowing different target formats, which include the central converter stylesheet for basic functionality
- First work on the MDWN and HTML converter stylesheets; these are just test files for showing the possibility of different output formats; many work has to be done to get them complete
- Small adaptions on the Readme and Todo files

- Start of the project.
- Search for a XSLT 2.0 capable processor, which is needed for generating more than one output file out of the basic TechML documentation, which comes in a single file.
- Experiments with the "multiple document" features of XSLT.
- First basic templates which split the input TechML into logical blocks along the different chapters.
- Creation of a group of recursive working templates which convert the plain TechML structure into a hierarchical one. This is mainly used for building up the path for the output documents.
